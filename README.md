# Goodreads Page Converter

Goodreads is a great site for tracking the books you read and seeing what your friends are reading. Unfortunately, many of the book detail records Goodreads uses are invalid. These records either have an incorrect number of pages for the book or list the book's length as the final page number not taking into consideration indeces, appendices, etc.

I created this app to convert my current page read to the adjusted page nuumber based on the actual page count or the page count minus the superfolous pages.
